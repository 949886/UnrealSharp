# UnrealSharp 0.1

## Introduction
UnrealSharp is a plugin for Unreal Engine 5 that allows game developers to use C# in their projects with the power of .NET 8. This plugin bridges the gap between C# and UE5, providing a seamless and efficient workflow for those who prefer C# over C++/Blueprints.

## Features
- **C# Integration**: Write your game logic in C#.
- **Seamless Unreal Engine 5 Compatibility**: Fully integrated with the latest UE5 features and API.
- **Hot reload:** Compile and reload code on the fly without having to restart the engine for changes.
- **Automatic Bindings:** Automatically generates C# API based on what is exposed to Blueprint. Which enables marketplace code plugins a seamless integration with UnrealSharp.

## Prerequisites
- Unreal Engine 5+
- Visual Studio / Rider
- .NET 8

## Biggest Caveats
- Linux/Max support is not yet implemented.
- Packaging not yet implemented.
- Multiplayer is almost done, but is not currently not working properly.
- Delegates exposed to Blueprint not yet implemented, can use pure C# delegates though.

## Special Thanks
I'd like to give a huge shoutout to [MonoUE](https://mono-ue.github.io/) (Sadly abandoned :( ) for the great resource for integrating C# into Unreal Engine. Some of the codebase are modified versions of their integration, and it's been a real time saver. Thank you MonoUE team!
